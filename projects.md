## Coding
- **[Best Albums of ****](projects/best_of.md)**
I used to listen to every new album to hit the streets. But after kids and getting old and lazy, I'm content delegating music discovery to the pros at <a href="https://pitchfork.com" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a> and <a href="https://boomkat.com" target="_blank">Boomkat</a> who publish annual lists of their favorite albums. One thing these lists don't have is a quick way to listen to all these albums, which is why I created my own webpages with embedded Spotify players.

- **[Degrees That Pay You Back](projects/college_degrees.html){:target="_blank"}**  
Like Wu-Tang said, cash rules everything around me, so what's a liberal arts major like me gotta do? Flip the script and use k-means clustering to find how to get that CREAM!
- **[Predicting Credit Card Approvals](projects/credit_score_prediction.html){:target="_blank"}**  
What exactly goes on in the mind of an actuary? Nothing good, I'm sure, but at least with logistic regression, we can peek under the hood.
- **[Forecasting Food Prices](projects/food_price_forecasts.html){:target="_blank"}**  
I pity the fool who gets between me and my potato. Being able to forecast food prices helps to anticipate what I need to do to make sure I get my potatoes. 
- **[Do Left-Handed People Really Die Young?](projects/left_handed_people.html){:target="_blank"}**  
I hope not, because my younger daughter is left handed ... and clumsy. To find the answer to this, I consulted Bayesian statistics.
- **[Finding Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries](projects/movie_plot_summaries.html){:target="_blank"}**  
How are the movies _2001_ and _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ similar? Is it because they're both sci-fi? Nah, let's use NLP and clustering to really find out!
- **[Extract Stock Sentiment from News Headlines](projects/stock_price_prediction.html){:target="_blank"}**  
Teachers say that we first learn to read and then read to learn. That's exactly what I tell my sentiment analyzer.
- **[TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game](projects/superbowl.html){:target="_blank"}**  
The Superbowl is a great way for musicians to get exposure in front of the largest TV audience in the U.S. So, who is the all-time king/queen of the halftime show?
- **[Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests](projects/taxi_fare_prediction.html){:target="_blank"}**  
Maybe if Robert Deniro's character Travis Bickle in _Taxi Driver_ took online classes on random forests and regression trees to find where to get the best fares and tips, he wouldn't have gone crazy.
