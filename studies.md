# Studies

Forecasting may seem like a very conventional and routine practice, but in my personal experience, people seem to confuse [judgmental forecasting](https://otexts.com/fpp2/judgmental.html) as the only type of forecasting. Although judgmental forecasting is indeed necessary when there is a lack of historical data, other more statistically robust methods should be considered when historical data begins to grow.

That is why I started diving into this area with Rob Hyndman's fantastic and free online textbook [_Forecasting: Principles and Practice_](https://otexts.com/fpp2).

Here are my answers to the chapter exercises:
