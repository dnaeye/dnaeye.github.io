# Studies
In an effort to level up my data analytics skills and improve my odds against Alzheimer's, I occasionally study stats or coding between Netflix and playing games.

## Forecasting

Forecasting may seem like a very conventional and routine practice, but in my personal experience, people seem to confuse [judgmental forecasting](https://otexts.com/fpp2/judgmental.html) as the only type of forecasting. Although judgmental forecasting is indeed necessary when there is a lack of historical data, other more statistically robust methods should be considered when historical data begins to grow.

That is why I started diving into this area with Rob Hyndman's fantastic and free online textbook [_Forecasting: Principles and Practice_](https://otexts.com/fpp2).

Here are my answers to the chapter exercises:

- [Ch. 7 Exercises](studies/fpp_ch7_exercises.nb.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Ch. 8 Exercises](studies/fpp_ch8_exercises.nb.html){:target="_blank"}

## Coding

I started my journey into data science with R, but I've since transitioned to Python because of its flexibility and acceptance as a lingua franca among data analysts, data scientists, and engineers. 

Here are some exercises for flexing Pythonic skills:
